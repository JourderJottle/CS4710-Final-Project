CS 4710 Final Project - Minesweeper AI

Our project is motivated by the opportunity to develop an AI capable of solving nearly any Minesweeper puzzle, minimizing reliance on luck while maximizing efficiency and accuracy. By combining constraint satisfaction with probabilistic reasoning, we aim to address the shortcomings of existing approaches. The AI we develop will recognize potential guessing situations and strategically avoid them wherever possible, favoring a deterministic, skill-based approach. This innovative direction is important because it introduces a novel way to approach Minesweeper puzzles that emphasizes decision-making over randomness, creating a more robust and capable solution.
